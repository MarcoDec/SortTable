Welcome !

This git repository contains a personal JS library 'mySortTable' with an example that you can see by opening 'index.html'.

This library requires :
- jquery
- bootstrap (for the glyphicons ;) )

The aim of this 'mySortTable' is to integrate in one js file the sorting functions of :
- an html 5 table without AJAX links (in-progress),
- an html 5 table with AJAX (not yet started)
